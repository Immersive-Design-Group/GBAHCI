# Abstract

While AI systems are not conscious participants in interactions with humans, they can be designed to engage in ways that feel fluid, responsive, and intuitive, aligning with principles drawn from human-to-human collaboration. This talk explores how insights from traditional collaboration technologies and human team dynamics can inform smoother human-AI interaction. 
Using examples from both classic collaborative systems and recent developments in AI-based tools, I will discuss approaches to design that foster AI “collaboration” without misrepresenting its limitations. Key topics include anticipating user intent, managing turn-taking, supporting implicit cues, and adapting AI responses to contextual nuances. This perspective on human-AI interaction promotes tools that blend into workflows naturally, emphasizing usability and coherence rather than perfect emulation of human intelligence.
