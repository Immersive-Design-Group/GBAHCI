# Abstract

In this talk, we present our project on AI-assisted animal-borne systems for studying animal behavior. To uncover the secrets of animal behavior, biologists attach sensor loggers (e.g., GPS, accelerometers, and cameras) to animals to record their movements and activities. These data are then analyzed to discover new insights or validate hypotheses. However, due to the weight constraints of these devices, the operational time of advanced loggers, such as cameras, is limited, making it challenging to capture intriguing animal behaviors effectively. In this talk, we introduce our AI-enabled bio-loggers, designed to autonomously detect and record interesting behaviors, overcoming these limitations.
