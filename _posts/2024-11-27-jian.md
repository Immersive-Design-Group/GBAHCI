# Abstract

The recent advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has been changing how we live, work, and dream, revolutionizing many industries through its versatile capabilities. Albeit many benefits, there exist numerous challenges when integrating AI agents into our current workflows. No matter how advanced the AI becomes, humans would remain in the loop at all times, concerned more with goals, operating at higher abstraction levels, and analyzing domain circumstances. My research takes a step to address the challenges using advanced interaction and visualization techniques, creating a harmony between human and AI. 

In this talk, I will discuss how these techniques can help users explore, understand, and communicate abstract data, insights, and ideas. I am going to showcase a range of example projects situated in various applications, such as programming, info-seeking, design, and therapy.


# Speaker
Jian is an Associate Professor at the School of Computer Science, University of Waterloo. I am affiliated with the WaterlooHCI lab. I am also a member of the Waterloo Artificial Intelligence Institute (Waterloo.ai) and the Waterloo Institute for Sustainable Aeronautics (WISA). I received my Ph.D from the Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto, where I was affiliated with the Dynamic Graphic Project (DGP) lab.
My research focuses on Data Science, Information Visualization (InfoVis), Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) as well as Visual Analytics. I develop novel interactive systems and visual representations that promote the interplay between humans, machines, and data. My research aims to boost the efficiency of human-data interaction with exploratory and explanatory interfaces that tightly integrate the flexibility and creativity of users with the scalability of algorithms and machine learning.
