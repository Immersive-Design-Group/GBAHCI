# Abstract

The traditional vision of ubiquitous computing is to make computing blend into the environment around us. While mobile devices have enabled ubiquitous and instant access to computing, such access is strictly confined to these tiny screens and devices. In this talk, Dr. Xiao will discuss his efforts to expand computing out of these devices and onto the world around us - making surfaces and environments come alive with rich touch interfaces, and making remote collaboration experiences more realistic and grounded through deeper integrations with the physical environment.
