# IMPORTANT DATES
- **April 22, 2024:** Deadline for submissions (AoE)
- **April 27, 2024:** Hybrid Doctoral Consortium.


# CALL FOR PARTICIPATION
The Doctoral Consortium (DC) of Pre-CHI Forum in Greater Bay provides an opportunity for doctoral students in the Greater Bay Area to discuss their research in a forum under the guidance of a panel of experienced HCI researchers. The DC will be held on April 27, 2024 as part of the pre-CHI event. Participants will be asked to give a presentation during the DC. They will receive feedback from mentors and coaches. 

The DCâ€™s primary purpose is to create a forum for promising PhD students to present and develop their research (i.e., dissertation projects). Community building is another significant goal. To achieve these goals, we will provide a forum for HCI PhD students in the Greater Bay Area to present their research, receive feedback, and informally engage with each other, as well as senior HCI scholars. Students will be able to participate either in-person or online, as the event will be in a hybrid form.

<u><strong>In-Person Mentoring</strong></u><br/>
This is an in-person half-day event on April 27, 2024. 

# WHO IS ELIGIBLE
Applicants should be Ph.D. students with an already established direction of research relevant to HCI, but whose research would benefit from guidance provided by peers and senior colleagues. Preference will be given to students who have a defined topic and program of work, i.e., who have proposed their topics and are within 2 years of graduation within a 5-year program or are halfway through a 4 year program.
